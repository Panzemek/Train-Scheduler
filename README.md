# Train-Scheduler
This website displays a fantasy train schedule, with a form for users to add to the schedule.

## Components
Formatting of the page is comprised almost entirely of bootstrap usage.  Javascript and jquery are used extensively for element modification and database access. Firebase is used as the database.

## Challenges
I have not yet figured out how to delete individual database elements.
